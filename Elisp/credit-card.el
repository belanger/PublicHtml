(defun creditcard-mode()
"Major mode for editing a buffer containing creditcard usage.
The following bindings provide the main functionality of this mode:

   \\[creditcard-append-transaction]\
        Append transaction to end of buffer.
   \\[creditcard-recalculate]\
        Recalculate creditcard of all transactions in buffer.
   \\[creditcard-change-field]     \
        Change the contents of the current field.
   \\[creditcard-toggle-credit]\
        Change whether the current line is a debit (the default),
        a credit (indicated by \"+\"), or sets the creditcard (indicated
        by \"=\").

When a transaction is noted in a statement, it should be noted with
   \\[creditcard-toggle-paid]\
        Toggle whether or not a check is marked as paid.
When a creditcard buffer is first opened, any sequences of paid checks will
be replaced by ellipses.  Typing RET on the ellipses will display the paid
checks, and any paid checks can be hidden with RET.

Checks can be move about with
    \\[creditcard-order-latest]\
        Put the latest entries (those since the last paid) in order by date.
    \\[creditcard-order-buffer]\
        Put all entries in order by date.
    \\[creditcard-kill-row]\
        Delete the current check.
    \\[creditcard-yank-row]\
        Copy the last killed check.

In addition, these bindings are defined to simplify editing
transactions:

   \\[creditcard-forward-field]\
        Move forward to start of next field (same as TAB).
   \\[creditcard-backward-field]\
        Move backward to start of previous field (same as shift-TAB).

Transactions occur on a single line and have the following fields (in
order):

   date           The transaction date in DD MMM YYYY format.
   paid           Status of transaction, x is paid.
   where          The place the transaction took place.
   description    A possibly blank transaction description.
   sign           This field must either be \"+\", \"-\", \" \" or \"=\".
                  + means credit, - or space means debit, 
                    and = resets creditcard.
   amount         The transaction amount.  You must enter this field.
 (\\[creditcard-recalculate]).

Changing any amount and recalculating again will update the total.
Transactions may be commented out by \\[creditcard-toggle-comment-out] (and 
uncommented out with the same command). This makes it easy to reconcile your
account with the bank, which is usually several transactions behind you.

To keep the file from getting too large, the command \\[creditcard-backup] will
make a copy of the current file (in the form `filename.n' for the smallest
number `n' for which the file doesn't already exist) and then replace any 
sequence of paid lines by a single line with an appropriate sign and amount.

Entering creditcard-mode runs the `creditcard-mode-hooks' if any exist.  There is
also a creditcard-mode-abbrev-table for the truly warped.
