<br>
Your grade will follow the guidelines:<br>
A 90% and above will guarantee an A.<br>
A 80% and above will guarantee a B.<br>
A 70% and above will guarantee a C.<br>
A 60% and above will guarantee a D.



<p><b><font size=+1>Solutions: </font></b><br>

<br>
When solving a problem, be sure to understand what you are being asked
and be sure to <b>answer the question</b> explicitly.

Be sure to write up your solution appropriately and understand what you are writing down.
For example:
<ul>
<li>
The solution to a math problem isn't simply a result, but rather the
process of getting to the proper result.

<li> 
All necessary steps should be justified.

<li>
Do not include unnecessary information.

<li>
Your solutions are not scratch work, they are written for other
people to read.

<li>
Solutions should be written the way that most people read; left to
right, top to bottom.  The writing should not jump around the page.

<li> 
Everything should be identified.<br>
(Never write an isolated expression; if you want to indicate that
<i>x</i> is equal to eight, you shouldn't just write <i>8</i> or even
<i>x &nbsp;&nbsp; 8</i>, you should write <i>x = 8</i>.)

<li>
Mathematical notation should be used appropriately and properly.<br>
For example:
<ul>
<li>
When solving <i>x^3 = 8</i>, should should <b>not</b> write
<i>x^3 = 8 = x = 2</i>, since the middle equal sign is incorrect.
<li>
To indicate that <i>x</i> is equal to 2, you should <b>not</b> write 
<i>x &rarr; 2</i>, the symbol <i>&rarr;</i> does not mean &ldquo;equals&rdquo;.
</ul>
</ul>
A solution which is not properly written down is not correct.

<p><b><font size=+1>Homework: </font></b><br>

<br>
Homework will be assigned but not collected.  They should be done
regularly to learn the material.  You should also practice writing up
nice solutions when you are doing the homeworks.

<p><b><font size=+1>Tests: </font></b><br>

<br>
For tests and quizzes, you can bring a calculator and standard pen or
pencil.  

The tests will not be made up of homework problems, but the
test problems will be based on the homework problems. Thus, the best
way to learn the material is to understand how to do the homework
problems.  You are expected to keep up with the work, not cram before
a test. I will not discuss several sections at once, and I will not
answer questions about tests and quizzes on the days they are given.

<p><b><font size=+1>Attendance: </font></b><br>

<br>
Attendance is not taken, but you are responsible for whatever
information that you missed.  

If you will be missing a test, you need a good reason (as
determined by the professor) and arrangements for a make-up test must
be made before the actual test.

<p><b><font size=+1>Disabilities: </font></b><br>

<br>
If you have a letter from the Disability Services Office, you should
discuss it with me the first week of class.

<p><b><font size=+1>Academic dishonesty: </font></b><br>

<br>
You know the difference between right and wrong. Be honest, don't cheat.
The Truman Catalog states:
<blockquote>
<br>
Students are expected to do their own academic work. Any student
involved in cheating on a paper, an examination or in any 
other form of academic dishonesty is subject to disciplinary action,
including suspension or expulsion from the class, the student's
academic program, or the University.
</blockquote>
On tests and quizzes, you must do your work yourself without looking
at other people's work or using any equipment or material not explicitly
allowed. Anyone caught cheating will have their grade affected, and may
even fail the class.

<p><b><font size=+1>Calculators: </font></b><br>

<br>
You may use calculators (including graphing calculators) on tests and
quizzes.  However, if you are expected to justify a result, simply
referring to the calculator is not sufficient.
