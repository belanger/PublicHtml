<p><b><font size=+1>Grading criteria: </font></b><br>

<br>
(See the note on solutions below.)<br>
The grading will be based on the following:
<ul>
  <li> Whether or not the solutions are written the way people read; left to
  right, top to bottom.
  <li> Whether or not you've identified everything you've written down.
  <li> Whether or not you've used notation correctly.
  <li> Whether or not you've justified what you've written down.
  <li> Whether or not you've written the answer at the end, as the
  conclusion, clearly identified.
  <li> Correctness.
</ul>

<p><b><font size=+1>Lectures: </font></b><br>

<br>
This class is largely lecture.  However, interaction between the
students and professor is still an important part of classtime, as
long as it is relevant to the class as a whole.  If the class is
moving too quickly or too slowly, you should say something.  If you
have something to add or say about the material, you should speak up.

<p><b><font size=+1>Paying attention: </font></b><br>

<br>
You should make it clear when you do your work that you are paying
attention.  For example, if you are doing a problem, pay attention to
the question.  Do the problem asked, and answer it.  When writing up a
solution, write in proper order and identify everything you write
down.  More on this below.

<p><b><font size=+1>Solutions: </font></b><br>

<br>
When solving a problem, be sure to understand what you are being asked
and be sure to <b>answer the question</b> explicitly and include any
necessary units.

Be sure to write up your solution clearly and appropriately.
This basically means:  Understand what is being
asked, understand what you are writing down, and don't be
unnecessarily lazy.  Keep in mind:
<ul>
<li>
The solution to a math problem isn't simply a result, but rather the
process of getting to the proper result.

<li> 
All necessary steps should be justified.

<li>
Make clear whether your statements are assumptions or are conclusions
that follow from previous statements.  Use words, as appropriate.
For example, instead of
\begin{center}
$x=1, y = 2, x + y = 3$
\end{center}
you should write
\begin{center}
Since $x=1, y = 2$, we know $x + y = 3$
\end{center}

<li>
Do not include unnecessary information.

<li>
While using scratch paper is part of solving math problems,
your solutions are not scratch work, they are written for other
people to read.

<li>
Solutions should be written the way that most people read; left to
right, top to bottom.  The writing should not jump around the page.

<li> 
Everything should be identified.<br>
(<b>Never</b> write an isolated expression; if you want to indicate that
<i>x</i> is equal to eight, you shouldn't just write <i>8</i> or even
<i>x &nbsp; 8</i>, you should write <i>x = 8</i>.)

<li>
Proper mathematical notation should be used; that means knowing what
the symbols you write down mean, and (for example) using equal signs
where they belong (and not using them where they don't belong).
Solving the equation <i>x<sup>3</sup>=8</i> by a string of equations such as
<i>x<sup>3</sup>=8=x=2</i> is incorrect, since <i>x</i> cannot be equal to both <i>8</i> and
<i>2</i>.  Similarly, computing <i>2<sup>3</sup></i> by writing <i>2<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8</i> is
incorrect, since an equal sign is missing.

<li>

Using words is often helpful and encouraged.

Don't use symbols from logic, such as <i>&there4;</i>, <i>&rArr;</i>
and <i>&forall;</i>.  Use words instead.
Arrows should not be used outside of their use in limits.

<li>
The numerical answer  should appear at the end of your solution,
explicitly identified.  If you are solving for <i>x</i> and determine it to
be <i>5</i>, the bottom of your work should have <i>x=5</i>.
</ul>
A solution which is not properly written is not correct.

<p><b><font size=+1>Homework: </font></b><br>

<br>
Homeworks will be assigned but not collected.  They should be done
regularly, as soon as the relevant section has been covered, to learn
the material.  You should also practice writing up 
nice solutions when you are doing the homeworks.

Many homework problems are simple exercises, where you do a problem
similar to one you've seen.  But some problems require a little more
thought and creativity.

% You don't learn the material by watching other people work on it, you
% learn it by doing it on your own.  Doing the homeworks yourself is how you
% learn the material.  I won't do the homeworks for you; if you need
% help, stop by and I will lead you through it.

<p><b><font size=+1>Office hours: </font></b><br>

<br>
My office hours are the times that I will be in my office (barring
some emergency).

Office hours are a time to ask questions or simply say hi.  They are not
a time to look for questions to ask; for example, if you stop by to
pick up a test, you should take it with you and not stay in my office
looking at it.  If you have a question on a homework problem, you need
to have already worked on it and have the written work to show it.

<p><b><font size=+1>Tests and Quizzes: </font></b><br>

<br>
There will be tests on the days listed above.  They will consist of
five problems, worth 10 points each.

There will be a quiz on most weeks when there isn't a test.  The
quizzes will consist of one problem, worth 10 points.  At the end of
the semester, only the quizzes whose percentage is above your average
test percentage will be counted toward your grade.

For tests and quizzes, you can bring a calculator and standard pen or
pencil.  The calculator must be an actual calculator (as opposed to a
phone app).  It can be a graphing calculator, but not one that does
symbolic manipulation (like a TI-89 or TI-92). Note that if
you are expected to justify a result, simply referring to the
calculator is not sufficient.

The tests and quizzes will not be made up of homework problems, but
they will be based on the homework problems. Thus, the best way to
learn the material is to understand how to do the homework problems.
You are expected to keep up with the work, not cram before a test. I
will not discuss several sections at once, and I will not answer
questions about tests and quizzes on the days they are to be given.

<p><b><font size=+1>Academic Dishonesty: </font></b><br>

<br>
You know the difference between right and wrong. Be honest, don't cheat.
On tests and quizzes, you must do your work yourself without looking
at other people's work or using any equipment or material not explicitly
allowed. You must finish the test by the end of the class.

Anyone caught cheating will have their grade affected, and may
even fail the class.

<p><b><font size=+1>Attendance Policy: </font></b><br>

<br>
Attendance is not taken, but <b>you</b>, and not the professor, are
responsible for whatever information that you missed.

Since a missed quiz can't lower your score, if you miss a quiz it
won't be made up.

If you will be missing a test, you need a good reason (as determined
by the professor) and arrangements for a make-up test must be made
<b>before</b> the actual test.

% <p><b><font size=+1>FAQ: </font></b><br>

% <ul>
% <li> <b>I need a certain grade for this class.  If I tell you 
% the grade I need, what will you do?</b><br>
% If you need a certain grade, that puts a
% burden on you, not the professor.  You won't get special
% considerations; you'll be graded according to the same rules that
% everyone else has.

% <li> <b>It's the end of the semester, and I need more points 
% to raise my grade.  What extra credit can I do?</b><br>
% There is no extra credit, all the points possible for the class are
% listed on the syllabus.  This is a semester long class; if you are
% trying for a certain grade, the process begins at the start of the
% semester.

% <li> <b>I'm worried that the professor might think that I'm paying 
% attention.  What can I do to show him that I am not?</b><br>
% Some suggestions are:
% <ul>
%   <li> You can ask for straightforward information that's on the
%   syllabus.    
%   <li> You can sloppily write down your answers on tests and quizzes.
%   You can drive the point home by asking why you missed points for
%   ignoring the syllabus.
%   <li> You can stop by the office to pick up a test or quiz, and then
%   stay in the office while you read it.
%   <li> You can ask about test/quiz material the day of the test/quiz.
%   <li> You can interrupt class for a question that only relates to you.
%   <li> You can ask for information about a class that
%   you missed.  
% </ul>
% There are plenty of other ways; use your imagination.
