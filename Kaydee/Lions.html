Lions are called the king of the jungle.  They have a ferocious roar
that tells the other lions that it is around and scares the other
types of animals.  The roar can be heard from far away.  If another
lion hears the roar, the lions can talk.

<p>
Lions are one of the few cats that live in groups.  A group of lions
is called a pride.  

<p>
The female lions, called lionesses, are the hunters in the pride.
Hunting as a group, the lionesses can catch very fast prey.
